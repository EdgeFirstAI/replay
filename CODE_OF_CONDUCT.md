# Contributor Covenant 3.0 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the
dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of
characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical
characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or
social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.
The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates
in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our
community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our
words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on
culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each
other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of
   gathering.
2. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
3. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
4. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
5. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
6. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
7. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our
   community**.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances,
threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of
Conduct.

1. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in
   unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
2. **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments
   directed at a community member or group of people.
3. **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone's personality or
   behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
4. **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered
   inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
5. **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone's personal or
   private information without their permission.
6. **Endangerment.** Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other
   harm toward any person or group.
7. Behaving in other ways that **threaten the well-being** of our community.
